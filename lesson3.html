        <h1>Alyssa Noel</h1>
        <h2>Digital Artist/Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>I am 19 years old. I am in college, majoring in Graphic Design. A fun fact about myself is that I graduated high school a year early.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy making art, mainly digital. I am quite creative when it comes to designs related to GD, as well as my art. I love all kinds of animals! Speaking of which, I have two cats.</p>
        <p>I am extremely interested in Japanese culture, I have been since my childhood. I love how colorful and unique most things are from Japan, as well as the Harajuku style and Anime. That interest greatly influences my art style, as well as my designs.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was young, I have been told that it is impressive how fast I am able to finish a drawing. That corelates with my skills to produce a design quickly when I focus on the visuals.</p>

          <p>July 2021</p>
          <p>My job is to help out with mostly everything. I chose to work then they have the least staff, so it can help them out, and I have more to do. I alternate between Drive Cashier, Custard, Set, Running, etc. Drive Cashier is simply cashing customers out in the Drive-Thru and sending them to park so their food can be brought to them. I am in charge of handing them their drinks and custard before giving them their number, after they pay. Custard is making the sundaes, shakes, smoothies, coolers, malts, concretes, etc. Set is gathering the food given from the kitchen and placing it all in a bag, along with napkins and condiments. Running is running the orders outside to the customers.</p>
          <p>Tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drive Cashier</li>
            <li>Custard</li>
            <li>Set</li>
